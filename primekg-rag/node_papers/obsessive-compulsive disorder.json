      "abstract": "This review finds that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and eating disorders share significant epidemiological and psychopathological similarities, entailing diagnostic challenges and potential for delayed treatment. Recent research suggests that several biological features are also shared between the diseases. However, further research is needed to explore this connection in more detail. Clinicians must identify the psychopathological features to ensure accurate diagnosis and outcome.",

      "title": "The speed of progression towards obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
      "abstract": "There is current interest in the elaboration of early intervention programs for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To this end, it is important to investigate the speed of progression from subthreshold symptoms to diagnosable OCD. In this study, we have retrospectively investigated the speed of progression towards full-blown OCD and sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with a faster transition. Patients enrolled in the Brazilian Research Consortium on Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders (N = 954) were interviewed with a comprehensive assessment battery that included the interval (in years) between the onset of subthreshold OCD symptoms and the onset of full-blown OCD. It took a median of 7 years (interquartile range: 2-13 years) for subthreshold symptoms to convert to diagnosable OCD. Faster OCD onset was associated with lower age at the time of assessment, male gender, being in new romantic states as precipitants for compulsions, greater severity of sexual/religious symptoms and lower severity of hoarding and YBOCS compulsions severity scores, greater rates of generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia without panic disorder, and negative family history for OCD. The retrospective design of this study allowed for susceptibility to memory bias about age at onset of OCD symptoms. We were unable to capture progressions taking less than 12 months. We could identify a specific phenotype that was more likely to escalate rapidly to clinical levels within this large clinical sample. This phenomenon may be particularly relevant in the context of selecting individuals for early intervention initiatives in situations when resources are scarce.",

      "title": "Clinical features of obsessive-compulsive disorder among individuals who experience health-related obsessive-compulsive symptoms.",
      "abstract": "While some obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) phenotypes are well-established and better understood, it is unclear whether the presence of health-related obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) is associated with specific clinical characteristics. We aimed to investigate whether OCS involving concerns with illness, diseases, body parts or aspects of appearance (i.e. health-related OCS) are associated with differences in demographics, experience of stressful life events, clinical severity, clinical course, endorsement of established OCD dimensions, and psychiatric comorbidities. Individuals (N = 1001) with a clinical diagnosis of OCD (M = 34.85, SD = 12.99) completed a questionnaire battery assessing clinical course (age at symptom onset, age at diagnosis, duration of illness), total and dimensional symptom severity, and psychiatric comorbidities. We ran initial univariate, and follow-up multivariate analyses where appropriate, to compare individuals reporting health-related OCS with those not reporting health-related OCS in terms of demographics, symptom severity and clinical course, OCD symptom dimensions, and psychiatric comorbidities. The presence of health-related OCS was associated with higher severity of contamination, hoarding and harm symptoms. Additionally, those with health-related OCS displayed significantly lower symptom insight, increased incidence of hypochondriasis, panic disorder and anxiety, and lower depression symptoms. Overall OCD symptom severity and clinical course did not differ between participants with and without health-related OCS. These novel findings provide clinicians with an enhanced understanding of health-related OCS in order to guide assessment and allow for more targeted treatment planning. Future investigations may examine the effectiveness of specialised treatment methods which target underlying clinical features of health-related OCS.",

      "abstract": "OCD symptoms are well documented in anorexia nervosa (AN) and to a lesser extent in bulimia nervosa (BN), yet remain virtually unstudied in binge-eating disorder (BED). In this cross-sectional observational study, 5927 participants with lifetime eating disorders (EDs) (i.e., past or current) were categorized into five groups based on their diagnostic histories: AN only (n = 2330), BN only (n = 740), BED only (n = 665), AN and another ED diagnosis (AN Mixed) (n = 1293), and BN and BED (BN-BED) (n = 899). Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-12 scores were compared across these groups and with OCD (n = 1040), anxiety-related disorders (ANX) (n = 423), and non-clinical community (NCC) (n = 1194) cohorts. OCD symptoms were common among individuals with lifetime AN, BN, BED, and multiple EDs, with obsessing being the most prevalent dimension, followed by ordering, checking, and washing. The obsessing scale, which captures general intrusive thoughts rather than traditional OCD obsessions, was notably high. ED groups generally scored higher on the OCI-12 subscales than the ANX and NCC cohorts but lower than the OCD cohort, although ordering severity was higher in some ED groups. Positive correlations were found between ED symptoms and OCI-12 subscales, and gender-diverse individuals and men had greater OCD symptoms than women. Clinicians should be vigilant for OCD symptoms in individuals with AN, BN, and BED. These findings call for research on the mechanisms linking EDs and OCD symptoms and support integrated treatment approaches for both conditions.",

      "title": "The natural history of lifetime psychiatric disorders in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder followed over half a century.",
      "abstract": "Few long-term studies have examined the life-time prevalence of comorbid psychiatric conditions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We therefore studied the frequency of comorbid psychiatric disorders, and their relation to onset and prognosis, in patients with OCD who were followed for almost half a century. During 1947-1953, 285 OCD patients were admitted as inpatients to a university hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. Among those, 251 (88%) accepted a structured comprehensive psychiatric examination in 1954-1956. In 1989-1993, 176 survivors were eligible and 144 (response rate 82%) were re-examined. The same psychiatrist performed both examinations. OCD was diagnosed according to the Schneider criteria, and other mental disorders according to DSM-IV. Mean follow-up since onset was 47 years. The lifetime frequency of depressive disorders was 84.7% (major depression 43.8%), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) 71.5%, panic anxiety disorder 47.9%, agoraphobia 52.1%, specific phobias 64.6%, social phobia 47.9%, paranoid conditions 40.3% (29.1% paranoid ideation), psychotic disorders 15.3%, alcohol abuse 13.2% (men 39%, women 3%) and substance abuse 17.4%. Specific phobia most often started before OCD, while depression had a varied onset in relation to OCD. Social phobia, agoraphobia, GAD, alcohol and substance abuse, psychotic disorders and paranoid conditions most often started after OCD. Presence of GAD, psychotic disorder and substance abuse worsened prognosis of OCD. Comorbid psychiatric conditions are common in OCD patients, and have onset throughout the course. OCD signals vulnerability for other psychiatric conditions, which are important to detect in clinical practice as they negatively affect the outcome.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbid with obsessive -compulsive personality disorder: subtype implications.",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by persistent obsessions and compulsions that lead to significant distress and functional impairment. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) frequently co-occurs in individuals with OCD and has been identified in several studies as the most prevalent personality disorder within this population. However, the clinical relevance of this comorbidity remains uncertain, particularly in terms of whether it reflects a distinct OCD subtype characterized by specific onset patterns and symptom dimensions. The present study aimed to examine whether OCD patients with and without comorbid OCPD differ in terms of age and mode of onset, as well as the content of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. We hypothesized that the presence of comorbid OCPD may define a clinically meaningful subtype of OCD. The sample consisted of 148 individuals diagnosed with OCD, all of whom underwent a comprehensive clinical evaluation. The following clinical variables were recorded: age at onset of OCD, mode of onset (acute vs. insidious), illness course (chronic vs. episodic), total duration of OCD, and other relevant clinical features including symptom severity and treatment history. Diagnostic assessments were conducted according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). In order to evaluate comorbid OCPD, participants were administered the OCPD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality Disorders (SCID- 5-PD), in conjunction with a self-report screener. The severity of current OC symptoms was assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), while depressive symptoms were measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Anxiety symptoms were also evaluated using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). Among 148 OCD patients, 58.8% met the diagnostic criteria for OCPD. While no differences were found in demographic variables, those with comorbid OCPD had higher lifetime counts of obsessions and compulsions, greater depression severity, and more severe OC symptoms. They also exhibited an earlier and more insidious onset of OCD and a more chronic illness course. Symmetry and hoarding obsessions, as well as ordering and hoarding compulsions, were more common in this group. Symmetry and hoarding obsessions, as well as ordering and hoarding compulsions, were more prevalent in the comorbid group. Binary logistic regression analysis identified earlier onset (OR = 2.45), insidious onset (OR = 2.68), higher depression severity (OR = 1.15), and presence of ordering compulsions (OR = 2.36) were significantly associated with OCD-OCPD comorbidity. Comorbid OCD and OCPD may represent a distinct subtype of OCD, characterized by insidious onset, early OC symptom onset, symmetry/ordering, hoarding obsessions and compulsions, and more severe depression. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing heterogeneity within OCD and highlight the need for targeted treatment strategies tailored to distinct clinical subtypes. Future studies should investigate the neurobiological mechanisms and developmental pathways underlying this comorbid presentation, as well as the potential efficacy of cognitive-behavioral interventions specifically designed to address both OC symptoms and maladaptive personality traits.",

      "title": "The impact of generalized anxiety disorder in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients.",
      "abstract": "Despite generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) being one of the most prevalent comorbidities in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), few studies have researched its impact on the OCD phenotype. The present study investigated how the sociodemographic and clinical profile of people with OCD with comorbid GAD differs from people with OCD without comorbid GAD. We hypothesised that the phenotype of the comorbid group would be closely related to GAD, in that it would more likely be female, have an earlier age at onset of OCD, and show an increased severity of fear-related OCD symptoms (aggressive, sexual/religious, and contamination dimensions), more avoidant behaviours, greater suicidality, more severe anxiety symptoms, and increased rates of comorbid anxiety and mood disorders. The study included 867 participants with OCD, with GAD being comorbid in 33.56%. Mann-Whitney U tests, chi-square tests with continuity correction, and logistic regressions were performed. Results showed that comorbid GAD was uniquely associated with an increased number of avoidant behaviours, greater anxiety severity, panic disorder without agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, and type II bipolar disorder. These results illustrate the clinical severity associated with this comorbidity and highlight markers that can aid diagnosis of GAD in OCD. Future studies should investigate whether this comorbidity has an impact on the treatment of OCD.",

      "title": "The relationship between obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety disorders: A question of diagnostic boundaries or simply severity of symptoms?",
      "abstract": "A growing number of studies are questioning the validity of current DSM diagnoses, either as \"discrete\" or distinct mental disorders and/or as phenotypically homogeneous syndromes. In this study, we investigated how symptom domains in patients with a main diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) coaggregate. We predicted that symptom domains would be unrelated to DSM diagnostic categories and less likely to cluster with each other as severity increases. One-hundred eight treatment seeking patients with a main diagnosis of OCD, SAD or PD were assessed with the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS), the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS), the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Revised (ASI-R), and the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI and BAI, respectively). Subscores generated by each scale (herein termed \"symptom domains\") were used to categorize individuals into mild, moderate and severe subgroups through K-means clusterization and subsequently analysed by means of multiple correspondence analysis. Broadly, we observed that symptom domains of OCD, SAD or PD tend to cluster on the basis of their severities rather than their DSM diagnostic labels. In particular, symptom domains and disorders were grouped into (1) a single mild \"neurotic\" syndrome characterized by multiple, closely related and co-occurring mild symptom domains; (2) two moderate (complicated and uncomplicated) \"neurotic\" syndromes (the former associated with panic disorder); and (3) severe but dispersed \"neurotic\" symptom domains. Our findings suggest that symptoms domains of treatment seeking patients with OCD and anxiety disorders tend to be better conceptualized in terms of severity rather than rigid diagnostic boundaries.",

      "abstract": "The anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder. In addition to the specific symptoms of these disorders, there may be a common experience of anxiety and even dysphoria across the conditions, and of course recourse to the same drug or choice of drugs for treatment. This overlap probably occurs because of universal dimensions of distress or negative affectivity, a shared genetic predisposition, and a common neurobiology Evidence of shared genes is still based mainly on twin studies, but the shared neurobiology can be investigated directly by the investigation of emotional or cognitive bias either behaviorally or using functional brain imaging. This intermediate phenotype can then provide a substrate for understanding and developing medicines and psychological treatments.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has a heterogeneous and complex phenomenological picture, characterized by different symptom dimensions and comorbid psychiatric disorders, which frequently co-occur or are replaced by others over the illness course. To date, very few studies have investigated the associations between specific OCD symptom dimensions and comorbid disorders. Cross-sectional, multicenter clinical study with 1001 well-characterized OCD patients recruited within the Brazilian Research Consortium on Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders. The primary instruments were the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Bivariate analyses between symptom dimensions and comorbidities were followed by logistic regression. The most common comorbidities among participants (56.8% females) were major depression (56.4%), social phobia (34.6%), generalized anxiety disorder (34.3%), and specific phobia (31.4%). The aggressive dimension was independently associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), separation anxiety disorder, any impulse-control disorder and skin picking; the sexual-religious dimension was associated with mood disorders, panic disorder/agoraphobia, social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, non-paraphilic sexual disorder, any somatoform disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and tic disorders; the contamination-cleaning dimension was related to hypochondriasis; and the hoarding dimension was associated with depressive disorders, specific phobia, PTSD, impulse control disorders (compulsive buying, skin picking, internet use), ADHD and tic disorders. The symmetry-ordering dimension was not independently associated with any comorbidity. Cross-sectional design; participants from only tertiary mental health services; personality disorders not investigated. Different OCD dimensions presented some specific associations with comorbid disorders, which may influence treatment seeking behaviors and response, and be suggestive of different underlying pathogenic mechanisms.",
