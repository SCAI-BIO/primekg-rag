      "title": "Bulimia nervosa and treatment-related disparities: a review.",
      "abstract": "Bulimia nervosa (BN) is a type of eating disorder disease usually manifesting between adolescence and early adulthood with 12 as median age of onset. BN is characterized by individuals' episodes of excessive eating of food followed by engaging in unusual compensatory behaviors to control weight gain in BN. Approximately 94% of those with BN never seek or delay treatment. While there are available treatments, some populations do not have access. Left untreated, BN can become severe and lead to other serious comorbidities. This study is a review of randomized controlled trials to explore available treatments and related treatment disparities. The objective of this review was to identify differences among treatment modalities of BN and aide in the further treatment and research of bulimia nervosa. This study followed narrative overview guidelines to review BN treatment studies published between 2010 and 2021. The authors used PubMed and PsychInfo databases to search for articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Search terms included phrases such as, BN treatment, BN and clinical trials, and BN and randomized clinical trials. Most of the reviewed studies had their sample sizes between 80 and 100% female with age range between 18 and 60â€‰years old. Sample sizes were mostly between 80 and 100% white. Treatment practices included both pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and limited motivational interviewing (MI). Most studies were in outpatient settings. Reviewed research shows that certain populations face disparities in BN treatment. Generally, individuals older than 60, males and racial minorities are excluded from research. Researchers and practitioners need to include these vulnerable groups to improve BN treatment-related disparities.",

      "title": "Bulimia Nervosa and Binge-Eating Disorder Across the Lifespan.",
      "abstract": "This article aims to review the current evidence-based psychotherapy and psychopharmacological treatments for adults and youths with bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED). Treatments for adults and for children and adolescents are discussed separately, including developmental considerations in the management of these disorders among youths. Although several evidence-based psychotherapy and psychopharmacological treatment options have been established for adults with BN or BED, there is much less empirical support for the management of these eating disorders among children and adolescents. This review concludes by discussing promising modalities and innovations, highlighting the potential utility of integrating technology into treatment approaches. Despite decades of treatment development and testing, a sizable proportion of individuals with BN or BED do not respond to the current evidence-based treatments, highlighting the need for continued research in these domains. Future research should focus on testing psychotherapy treatments among diverse samples in large, randomized controlled trials, as well as on treatments that can be easily scaled and implemented in community settings.",

      "title": "Can people with longstanding bulimia nervosa suffer from severe and enduring eating disorder? A qualitative study.",
      "abstract": "To interview a series of individuals with bulimia nervosa of longstanding to establish their symptoms and examine the suggestion, using qualitative analysis, that the term \"Severe and Enduring Bulimia Nervosa (SEED-BN)\" might be appropriate and helpful. 12 participants with Bulimia Nervosa, one male, were interviewed with the help of an interview guide. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were analysed using Thematic Analysis. Participants with Bulimia Nervosa described serious problems in many realms, especially social, psychological, family and relationships. Bulimia nervosa of long duration is associated with many serious symptoms. It seems likely that recognition of long-standing bulimia nervosa as a severe and enduring eating disorder could encourage clinicians and families to pay attention to the wide variety of problems suffered by this group. Further research is required to examine this proposal.",

      "title": "Why are so many individuals with bulimia nervosa low in weight suppression?",
      "abstract": "Weight suppression (WS) is associated with many problematic characteristics in individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN). It is theorized that WS contributes to eating disorder (ED) characteristics through the initiation of metabolic and appetitive responses that contribute to dysregulated food intake and weight gain. However, some individuals with BN exhibit little or no WS, and we investigated two possible explanations for this: that low-WS individuals were once weight-suppressed but regained most of the weight they previously lost, or that low-WS individuals never underwent the large weight losses that some of those with BN have shown. Participants were 453 female patients with BN. We used mixed-model ANOVAs to compare individuals with low and high WS on four weight variables (i.e., premorbid high, postmorbid high, postmorbid low, and current z-BMI). We conducted these analyses using a new, developmentally sensitive measure called developmental weight suppression (DWS). Our results revealed strikingly different weight histories between low and high WS groups. The high WS groups displayed dramatic weight losses (and only partial weight regain), but the low WS groups demonstrated only modest weight losses and an overall pattern of weight gain over time. Individuals with BN and low WS do not show the same large and rapid z-BMI losses that are characteristic of most individuals with BN; rather, they show patterns of weight gain that are more characteristic of individuals with BED. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to include individuals who never lost significant weight in studies of WS in BN, as weight suppression would not be relevant to their presentation. Thus, there may be two groups of individuals with BN: those for whom weight suppression is a maintaining factor of binge eating, and those for whom it is not.",

      "title": "A test of the social withdrawal syndrome hypothesis of bulimia nervosa.",
      "abstract": "The study examined the social withdrawal syndrome (SWS) hypothesis of bulimia nervosa (BN). According to the hypothesis, eating disorders such as BN are associated with a coherent set of social withdrawal cognitions, affect, and behavior. Eight-eight young female adults completed a standardized measure of bulimic symptoms and measures of social withdrawal (affective withdrawal, trust beliefs in close others, and disclosure). Participants were engaged in a laboratory-based peer interaction which yielded the SWS measure of perceived lack of social connectiveness. Bulimic symptoms were associated with each measure of social withdrawal. Structural equation modeling analysis confirmed that those measures contributed to a coherent latent factor which was associated with bulimic symptoms. The findings supported the social withdrawal syndrome hypothesis of BN and have implications for the detection and treatment of eating disorders.",

However, closely examining the supplementary material of that article reveals that these numbers cannot possibly be correct. Instead, most studies indicate that the prevalence of 'food addiction' is higher than 80% in persons with bulimia nervosa and, thus, higher than in persons with other eating disorders.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are eating disorders associated with life-threatening multisystemic medical complications. This narrative review aimed to present the medical complications most related to these disorders. In anorexia nervosa, many of them are linked to malnutrition and underweight, usually reversible with renutrition and weight restoration, although refeeding can also be linked to some medical complications. Purging behaviors observed in the anorexia nervosa binge-purging subtype and bulimia nervosa have been mainly related to hydrolectrolyte and acid-base disturbances, in addition to local complications. Thus, an early identification and therapeutic intervention of these disorders is considered crucial. Integral medical monitoring should be ensured to prevent potential serious complications from the early stages, with the involvement of physicians, psychologists, nutritionists, and other specialists in a multidisciplinary approach according to the patient's needs.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders affect millions of people worldwide, but most never receive treatment. The majority of clinical research on eating disorders has focused on individuals recruited from treatment settings, which may not represent the broader population of people with eating disorders. This study aimed to identify potential differences in the characteristics of individuals with eating disorders based on whether they self-reported accessing treatment or not, in order to contribute to a better understanding of their diverse needs and experiences. The study population included 762 community-recruited individuals (85% female, Mâ€‰Â±â€‰SD ageâ€‰=â€‰30â€‰Â±â€‰7 years) with bulimia nervosa or binge-eating disorder (BN/BED) enrolled in the BingeÂ Eating Genetics Initiative (BEGIN) United States study arm. Participants completed self-report surveys on demographics, treatment history, past and current eating disorder symptoms, weight history, and their current mental health and gastrointestinal symptoms. Untreated participants (nâ€‰=â€‰291, 38%) were compared with treated participants (nâ€‰=â€‰471, 62%) who self-reported accessing BN/BED treatment at some point in their lives. Untreated participants disproportionately self-identified as male and as a racial or ethnic minority compared with treated participants. Treated participants reported a more severe illness history, specifically, an earlier age at onset, more longstanding and frequent eating disorder symptoms over their lifetime, and greater body dissatisfaction and comorbid mental health symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, ADHD) at the time of the study. A history of anorexia nervosa was positively associated with treatment engagement. Individuals self-reporting a history of inpatient or residential treatment exhibited the most severe illness history, those with outpatient treatment had a less severe illness history, and untreated individuals had the mildest illness history. Historically overlooked and marginalized populations self-reported lower treatment access rates, while those who accessed treatment reported more severe eating disorder and comorbid mental health symptoms, which may have motivated them to seek treatment. Clinic-based recruitment samples may not represent individuals with milder symptoms or racial and ethnic diversity, and males. Community-based recruitment is crucial for improving the ability to apply research findings to broader populations and reducing disparities in medical research.

      "title": "The role of eco-anxiety in the presentation of bulimia nervosa: a case report.",
      "abstract": "Despite a growing literature demonstrating the significant impacts of climate change on mental health, research is urgently needed to investigate how climate change-related concerns may contribute to the development, exacerbation, or re-emergence of eating disorders, as well as affect the effectiveness of existing interventions. This case report contributes to this scant knowledge base by offering empirical evidence for how responses to climate change can influence eating disorder symptoms and, importantly, limit the effectiveness of evidence-based treatments such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy-Enhanced (CBT-E). A 24-year-old female graduate student studying environmental science presented to a specialized eating disorder clinic with worsening bulimia nervosa. Her symptoms initially improved with CBT-E; however, after three months, concerns about food waste significantly impeded further progress. The therapist, identifying symptoms of eco-anxiety, adapted standard CBT-E strategies to include psychoeducation about eco-anxiety, cognitive restructuring of beliefs about food waste and other eating-related eco-concerns, relevant exposures related to such concerns, and problem-solving to increase social support. These adaptations led to resumed progress, with the patient achieving nutritional adequacy by treatment end (38 sessions) and maintaining treatment gains through one year follow-up. To our awareness, this is the first case report on the co-occurrence of eco-anxiety and eating disorders. This case underscores the importance of screening for concurrent eco-anxiety, suggests ways in which eating disorders and eco-anxiety can influence one another longitudinally, describes how coexisting eco-anxiety can limit standard CBT-E's effectiveness, and provides examples of successful treatment adaptations tailored to address eco-anxiety-related concerns.",
