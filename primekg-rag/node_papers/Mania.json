      "abstract": "Recurrent [hypo]mania without major depressive episodes (\"unipolar mania\" [UPM]) is an uncommon form of major affective disorder related to bipolar disorder (BD). We characterized UPM patients and estimated the prevalence of their characteristics based on prolonged times-at-risk. Using standard bivariate and multivariate statistics, we compared the characteristics of 63 consecutive UPM patients to 1210 other BD patients over prolonged, close, prospective follow-up at expert mood disorder centers. UPM was uncommon (4.95% of 1273 BD cases during 18.2 years at risk) with a 2.5-fold excess of men and 93.4% considered type I BD. UPM cases had earlier initial clinical interventions than other BD patients, more psychotic features with first episodes, and fewer UPM patients were married but did not have fewer children and were more unemployed. UPM cases experienced more morbidity (episodes and hospitalizations/year and %-time ill) than other BD patients and made more follow-up clinic visits/year. They were less likely to be suicidal and had less general medical comorbidity but did not differ in substance abuse. They had lower ratings of depressive symptoms, used mood stabilizers more, and as expected, received antidepressants 27 times less than other BD patients. Observed rates of UPM declined with longer observation times. UPM was uncommon (4.95% of BD cases; 0.31% with hypomania only). Compared to ordinary BD, UPM had significantly greater morbidity and unemployment but a lower risk of suicidal behavior or general medical disorders associated with bipolar depression. This unusual disorder needs greater recognition, clarification of its nosological status, and efforts to optimize its treatment.",

      "title": "Informing the dimensional classification of mania: A daily diary study of symptom-level structure.",
      "abstract": "The optimal classification of mania symptoms within dimensional models such as the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology remains unclear, although progress has been made recently. We extend dimensional classification research by assessing mania and other domains at the symptom level using a longitudinal, daily diary design (7-day period). Participants (N = 230; 1,243 total surveys) were adults recruited online based on having a self-identified history of significant mental health issues. Consistent with recent cross-sectional research, mania symptoms associated strongly with thought disorder at the between-person level, and they also associated strongly with some externalizing features across levels of analysis (i.e., within- and between-person). Regarding specific within-person results, select mania symptoms were more distinctive from other symptoms assessed overall, although mania symptoms still associated robustly with thought disorder in many cases. A subset of mania symptoms (e.g., euphoric mood) also had robust negative within-person associations with internalizing symptoms. These findings inform understanding of mania symptoms' daily associations and dimensional assessment, although several limitations are important to keep in mind. These limitations included some item ratings having limited within-person variability, as well as our study sampling period focusing on only 7 days. We hope that future research will address these limitations in other samples toward improving the dimensional classification and assessment of mania and other symptoms.

      "abstract": "Current evidence for pharmacological treatment of mania during hospitalisation is insufficient as there are no larger well-designed randomised trials of comparative medical treatments of mania during inpatient stays. Moreover, there is considerable variation in pharmacological medication in clinical practice during hospitalisation for mania. Based on a hospital data overview, a systematic search of the literature and a three-day consensus meeting, this narrative review proposed an algorithm for optimised pharmacological treatment of mania during hospitalisation and its subsequent scientific evaluation.",

      "title": "Case identification and healthcare utilization in the years prior to a first mania diagnosis.",
      "abstract": "There is limited evaluation of approaches to identify patients with new onset bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) when using administrative datasets. Using the Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Database (APCD), we identified individuals with a 2016 diagnosis of bipolar disorder with mania and examined patterns of psychiatric and medical care over the preceding 48 months. Among 4806 individuals aged 15-35 years with a 2016 BPAD with mania diagnosis, 3066 had 48 months of historical APCD data, and of those, 75 % involved information from ≥2 payors. After excluding individuals with historical BPAD or mania diagnoses, there were 583 individuals whose 2016 BPAD with mania diagnosis appeared to be new (i.e., 34 new diagnoses per 100,000 individuals aged 15-35 years). Most individuals received medical care, e.g., 98 % had outpatient visits, 76 % had Emergency Department (ED) visits, and 50 % had mental health-related ED visits during the 48 months prior to their first mania diagnosis. One-third (37.2 %) had a depressive episode before their initial BPAD with mania diagnosis. Study was conducted in one state among insured individuals. We used administrative data, which permits evaluation of large populations but lacks rigorous, well-validated claims-based definitions for BPAD. There could be diagnostic uncertainty during illness course, and clinicians may differ in their diagnostic thresholds. Careful examination of multiple years of patient history spanning all payors is essential for identifying new onset BPAD diagnoses presenting with mania, which in turn is critical to estimating population rates of new disease and understanding the early course of disease.",

      "title": "Silence as epistemic agency in mania.",
      "abstract": "Silence is a byword for socially imposed harm in the burgeoning literature on epistemic injustice in psychiatry. While some silence is harmful and should be broken, this understanding of silence is untenably simplistic. Crucially, it neglects the possibility that silence can also play a constructive epistemic role in the lives of people with mental illness. This paper redresses that neglect. Engaging with first-person accounts of mania, it contends that silence constitutes a crucial form of epistemic agency to people who experience mania and that the prevailing failure to recognise this may harm them. The paper proceeds as follows. After briefly examining the negative understanding of silence in the epistemic injustice literature, it outlines three epistemically agential silences: communicative silence, listening silence, and withholding silence. It then deploys these concepts to explore how the ability to perform epistemically agential silence is impaired in mania and why such silences are vital to people. The penultimate section highlights two ways that the failure to recognise the epistemic value of silence can harm people with mania. The paper concludes by drawing out implications for future research on epistemic injustice in psychiatry.",
