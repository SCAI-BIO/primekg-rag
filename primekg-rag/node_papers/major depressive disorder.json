      "title": "[Long-term courses of major depressive disorder : Characteristics, risk factors and the definitional challenge of treatment response].",
      "abstract": "The definition of long-term courses of depression is heterogeneous. Chronic and treatment-resistant courses, in particular, represent a high-cost factor and greatly reduce the quality of life. Based on the pharmacotherapeutic treatment-resistant depression (TRD), more and more systemic approaches are becoming important. This narrative review provides an overview of the long-term course of depressive disorders, including various definitions and influencing factors. In addition, an overview of biomarker research on treatment response with a focus on neuroimaging is presented. A selective literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar for a narrative review. Particular attention was given to larger cohort studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and studies on the prediction of treatment response. Chronic and treatment-resistant courses mean a relevant reduction in the quality of life and increased health risks. The assessment of treatment response is a definitional challenge: An alternative to TRD is the systemically oriented difficult to treat depression (DTD). The focus is thus moving away from symptom reduction towards controlling the level of functioning. Biomarker research for treatment response offers potential but currently mainly serves to gain theoretical knowledge. Recording the long-term course of depressive illnesses is important, but also complex. Clinical interventions should therefore include a continuous monitoring and the focus on maintaining the quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Major depression is a syndrome that can be triggered by numerous physical and psychosocial factors. Concurrent somatic complaints can complicate the diagnosis. Patient evaluation requires a comprehensive history, physical and mental status examinations, and a number of laboratory studies. Effective treatment of depression enhances the quality of life, reduces the probability of secondary alcoholism or suicide, frequently improves coexisting medical problems and reduces the high rate of health care use by these patients.",

      "title": "Antidepressant Therapy and Depression Disorder.",
      "abstract": "<b>Introduction</b>: Treatment-resistant depression represents a serious clinical problem and a significant public health challenge. Research highlights the importance of combining selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with antidepressants that act as antagonists of presynaptic α2-autoreceptors and α2-heteroreceptors, such as Mianserin, Trazodone, and Mirtazapine. <b>Aim</b>: to evaluate the effectiveness of combined therapy using Mirtazapine (α2-autoreceptor antagonist) and Sertraline (serotonin reuptake inhibitor) in treating depression. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: This prospective study included 30 patients of both sexes, aged between 21 and 39 years, diagnosed with depressive disorder (F32). Patients were evaluated at the private psychiatric institution \"Dr. Zora Mitic\" over a period of three months. Participants were assessed at baseline and after one and three months of treatment with combined antidepressant therapy consisting of Mirtazapine (15-30 mg/day) and Sertraline (50-100 mg/day). Sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, marital status, education level, and employment) were collected using a specifically designed questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and sexual dysfunction was assessed using the Sexual Dysfunction Scale. <b>Results</b>: A Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated a statistically significant decrease in Hamilton Rating Scale (HRS) scores after one month (Z = -4.717, P ≤ 0.001) and three months (Z = -4.787, P ≤ 0.001) of treatment compared to pre-treatment scores. Additionally, the difference in HRS scores between one-month and three-month treatment periods was also significant (Z = -4.717, P ≤ 0.001). <b>Conclusion</b>: The results of our study demonstrate that initiating combined antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment is highly effective.",

      "title": "Major depressive disorder.",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by persistent depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyable activities, recurrent thoughts of death, and physical and cognitive symptoms. People with MDD can have reduced quality of life owing to the disorder itself as well as related medical comorbidities, social factors, and impaired functional outcomes. MDD is a complex disorder that cannot be fully explained by any one single established biological or environmental pathway. Instead, MDD seems to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, psychological and biological factors. Treatment for MDD commonly involves pharmacological therapy with antidepressant medications, psychotherapy or a combination of both. In people with severe and/or treatment-resistant MDD, other biological therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy, may also be offered.",

      "title": "Anxiety and depressive personality disorders in the modern world.",
      "abstract": "The study's significance lies in the multitude of challenges facing individuals today, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, military conflicts like the war in Ukraine, and the escalating rates of cancer morbidity and mortality. These factors contribute to the onset of anxiety and depressive disorders, disrupting various aspects of individuals' mental functioning and social interactions. Addressing these disorders effectively necessitates a comprehensive approach, combining pharmacological interventions with psychotherapeutic strategies under the guidance of specialized professionals. In this regard, the study is aimed at identifying aspects and features of the development of psychological problems and personality disorders in the modern world filled with various stressors. The leading methods of studying this problem are analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, comparison, experiment and systematisation of approaches that will help determine a wide range of mental disorders. Theoretical methods were used to analyze the literature and summarize theoretical material on anxiety and depressive disorders. Diagnostic methods were used to assess the psychological state of the study population. The study examines significant clinical syndromes and vegetative disorders that disrupt normal lifestyle, hinder daily activities, and impede professional growth. It evaluates the roles of psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers in assisting individuals with anxiety disorders. It outlines preventive measures for anxiety and depression, while also delving into various types of anxiety disorders. The research proposes diverse methods to prevent emotional anxiety and instability. It underscores the importance of devising novel strategies for diagnosis and therapy, emphasizing a comprehensive approach involving psychotherapeutic support, medical intervention, and adaptive behavioral techniques. The findings of the study hold both practical and theoretical significance for professionals in psychology, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, and sociology who provide support for individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders. Furthermore, the insights provided may be pertinent to researchers and scholars investigating the psychological well-being of contemporary society amidst adverse external circumstances.",

      "title": "What Is the Depressive Mixed State?-Associated Factors Beyond Bipolarity.",
      "abstract": "To elucidate the differences in associated factors beyond bipolarity between Benazzi's depressive mixed state (DMX), defined as a major depressive episode (MDE) with ≥ 3 manic/hypomanic symptoms, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition criteria for mixed features (DSM-5-DMX), defined as an MDE with ≥ 3 non-overlapping manic/hypomanic symptoms. The associations of DMX definitions with bipolarity, anxious distress (ANXD), autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and older age were retrospectively examined in 160 patients with MDEs. Benazzi's DMX and DSM-5-DMX were identified in 48.8% and 1.9% of participants, respectively. Bipolar disorder (BD) and ANXD diagnoses were independently associated with Benazzi's DMX (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 3.70 [1.79-7.67], p < 0.001, and 6.14 [2.96-12.76], p < 0.001, respectively). Benazzi's DMX was also associated with several features of poor prognosis and psychiatric adverse events related to antidepressant treatment. As the low frequency of DSM-5-DMX did not allow for its statistical analysis, a post hoc analysis of an MDE with ≥ 2 non-overlapping symptoms, accounting for 19.4% of participants, was performed. Similar to Benazzi's DMX, BD and ANXD diagnoses were independently associated with this definition of DMX. Moreover, the odds ratio of BD diagnosis was higher than that of ANXD. Benazzi's DMX was independently associated with bipolarity and ANXD, and was also associated with poor prognosis. Exclusively defined DMX, such as DSM-5-DMX, may be more specifically associated with bipolarity; however, its sensitivity for predicting bipolarity is low for clinical practice. Further studies are required to validate these findings.",

      "abstract": "The clinical features, genetic data, psychopharmacological studies, hormonal abnormalities, and biochemical observations all serve to define major depressive illness as an inherited neurochemical disorder affecting the hypothalamus, and probably involving monoamine pathways. While the precise nature of the defect and its mode of transmission remain obscure, the rapid development of this field in less than two decades permits optimism that major depressive illness illness will be among the first \"functional\" psychiatric disorders to have its chemical pathology elucidated.",
