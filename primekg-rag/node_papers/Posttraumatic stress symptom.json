      "title": "Is Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in a Class of Its Own? Longitudinal Comparison to Other Conditions Following Trauma and Life Stress Exposure.",
      "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined by the assumption that qualifying traumatic events lead to a syndrome distinct from other internalizing disorders, while stressful life events play a prominent role in etiologic theories of major depressive disorder (MDD). We examined whether the environmental etiology of PTSD and MDD are distinct by evaluating the relative contributions of traumatic and stressful life events to both conditions. Harmful alcohol use and physical limitations served as noninternalizing comparators expected to show weaker associations with environmental factors. <b>Methods:</b> Longitudinal cohort study of World Trade Center disaster responders who completed annual assessments of mental health and physical functioning from July 1, 2002, to December 31, 2020. Psychiatric diagnoses were ascertained in clinical interviews. Multivariate regression and multilevel modeling quantified the percentage of variance in psychopathology and physical limitations attributable to trauma versus life stress. <b>Results:</b> 11,153 responders (mean age on September 11, 2001: 37.5 years; 91% male) completed 61,244 visits. The combined environmental effect of 9/11-trauma and life stress on PTSD and MDD was nearly identical (14.3% and 14.8% of between person variability), but much weaker for alcohol use and physical limitations (0.8% and 9.1%). Life stress explained the most variance in all diagnoses and symptoms across longitudinal and cross-sectional analytic strategies. <b>Conclusions:</b> In the longest study to date coexamining the environmental etiology of PTSD and MDD, trauma and life stress contributed to both conditions. Considering a spectrum of exposures from stressful life events to trauma and integrating knowledge across internalizing conditions may advance understanding and treatment of stress related psychopathology.",

      "title": "Incidence and Clinical Features of Panic Related Posttraumatic Stress.",
      "abstract": "The current study assessed the incidence and associated features of posttraumatic stress after the experience of panic. One hundred seventy-eight participants meeting diagnostic criteria for panic attacks (PAs) were assessed using standardized measures of posttraumatic symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in specific reference to their experience of panic. Sixty-three (35.4%) participants scored above the cutoff for PTSD in reference to the worst PA they had experienced. Adjusted means for the four PTSD symptom clusters indicate that panic-related posttraumatic symptoms are, on average, experienced \"moderately\" to \"quite a bit.\" Panic-related posttraumatic symptoms and PTSD were best predicted by specific features of the panic experience itself, including subjective levels of distress, fear of losing control, chest pain, agoraphobia, and number of PAs experienced. These findings are discussed in terms of the diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment implications for a subset of individuals presenting with panic who may also have panic-related PTSD.",

      "title": "Identifying Trends in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms, Type of Trauma, and Associated Features: A Latent Class Analysis.",
      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to identify salient groupings of trauma survivors based on <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (<i>DSM</i>)<i>-5</i> posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. Latent class analysis was used in 365 outpatient mental health trauma survivors. We identified six classes with two spectra-prominent avoidance and negative alterations in cognitions/mood (NACM)-and a resilient class (a plurality). Sexual assaults were more common among avoidance-prominent classes, and suicide attempts and tobacco problems were more common among NACM-prominent classes. Previous studies have found classes differentiated by numbing, but this is the first since numbing was subsumed by <i>DSM-5</i>'s NACM. Our findings suggest that avoidance and numbing are distinct symptoms (consistent with <i>DSM-5</i>) but indicate that current nosology may miss individuals with high numbing and low avoidance despite their distinct suicide risks.",

      "title": "Stress dynamics that maintain posttraumatic stress disorder across 20 years.",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often chronic and impairing. Mechanisms that maintain symptoms remain poorly understood because of heterogenous presentation. We parsed this heterogeneity by examining how individual differences in stress-symptom dynamics relate to the long-term maintenance of PTSD. We studied 7,308 trauma-exposed World Trade Center responders who self-reported PTSD symptoms and stressful life events at annual monitoring visits for up to 20 years (average = 8.8 visits; [range = 4-16]). We used multilevel structural equation models to separate the stable and time-varying components of symptoms and stressors. At the within-person level, we modeled stress reactivity by cross-lagged associations between stress and future symptoms, stress generation by cross-lagged associations between symptoms and future stress, and autoregressive effects represented symptom persistence and stress persistence. The clinical utility of the stress-symptom dynamics was evaluated by associations with PTSD chronicity and mental health care use. Stress reactivity, stress generation, and symptom persistence were significant on average (bs = 0.03-0.16). There were significant individual differences in the strength of each dynamic (interquartile ranges = 0.06-0.12). Correlations among within-person processes showed some dynamics are intertwined (e.g. more reactive people also generate stress in a vicious cycle) and others represent distinct phenotypes (e.g. people are reactive or have persistent symptoms). Initial trauma severity amplified some dynamics. People in the top deciles of most dynamics had clinically significant symptom levels across the monitoring period and their health care cost 6-17× more per year than people at median levels. Individual differences in stress-symptom dynamics contribute to the chronicity and clinical burden of PTSD.",

      "title": "Risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder in patients with multiple injuries and its relationship with anxiety and depression.",
      "abstract": "Patients with multiple injuries endure not just physical trauma and suffering but are also at risk of psychological conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. The co-occurrence of PTSD in these patients may cause prolonged physical and mental health complications, thereby further increasing their healthcare expenses. To determine the association between the high-risk factors of PTSD and anxiety as well as depression among patients with multiple injuries. This study selected 110 patients with multiple injuries who were admitted to our hospital from November 2022 to November 2024. The number and percentage of patients developing PTSD were tallied. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate the high-risk factors of PTSD in these patients. Subsequently, the associations between these factors and the anxiety and depression levels of patients were analyzed. Of the 110 patients, 33 suffered from PTSD, representing an incidence rate of 30.0%. The univariate analysis identified age, personality, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), economic status, negative life events, and smoking history to be significantly associated with PTSD in patients with multiple injuries. Further, the multivariate analysis revealed age, HAMA, HAMD, monthly income, and negative life events as prominent high-risk factors for PTSD in such patients. Regarding the relationships between these factors and HAMA and HAMD, age exhibited a significant positive correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.398, <i>P</i> < 0.001; <i>r</i> = 0.387, <i>P</i> < 0.001), monthly income showed a significant negative correlation (<i>r</i> = -0.437, <i>P</i> < 0.001; <i>r</i> = -0.319, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and negative life events demonstrated a significant positive correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.505, <i>P</i> < 0.001; <i>r</i> = 0.365, <i>P</i> < 0.001). These results indicate age, HAMA, HAMD, monthly income, negative life events, <i>etc.</i> as high-risk factors for PTSD in patients with multiple injuries, among which age, monthly income, and negative life events are closely associated with anxiety and depression.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic stress symptoms and unmet needs in cancer survivorship.",
      "abstract": "Cancer diagnosis can be distressing, leading to multidimensional care needs which are often not fully met. The experience of diagnosis and treatment may be traumatizing for some patients, leading to a greater demand for support during survivorship. Survivors exposed to trauma may also have a harder time addressing their own needs or require additional support for their needs which have been neglected by the available care. We examined the degree to which exposure to trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms influence cancer survivor unmet needs, and the role of unmet needs in survivor life satisfaction. Survivors diagnosed with cancer in the past year or prior (<i>N</i> = 1,138) from a nationally representative population (<i>N</i> = 11,708) reported Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACES-Q-10) and PTSD symptoms (PTSD-8). Unmet needs were reported on the Survivor Unmet Needs Survey (SF-SUNS). Life satisfaction was measured on a single item. Chronic pain, sociodemographic variables, and self-reported cancer stage were self-reported and included as covariates. In stepwise-hierarchical regression modeling, PTSD symptoms, advanced-stage cancer and younger age were significant predictors of unmet needs in the first year after diagnosis and in the years thereafter (<i>p</i>s < 0.001); but the influence of ACEs on unmet needs was overshadowed by the other variables in the regression model. Chronic pain was associated with unmet needs experienced after one year (<i>p</i> < 0.001) but not in the first year after diagnosis. Having more unmet needs predicted poor life satisfaction when controlling for income, education, and age (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Findings suggest that cancer survivors with a trauma history and PTSD symptoms are more vulnerable to unmet needs, which contributes to poor life satisfaction. Trauma-informed care and PTSD treatment, especially in younger survivors and those with advanced-stage cancers, may mitigate the potential for unmet needs after cancer diagnosis and thereby improve health outcomes in survivorship.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Traumatic exposures are often assessed in clinical and research settings by a list of events chosen because they meet the definition of trauma required for the ICD-11 or DSM-5 diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some trauma measures include an 'other' option, with a text box enabling participants to describe an event not listed.<b>Objective:</b> There were three aims in this study: (1) to identify commonly endorsed 'other' events not listed on a standard measure of trauma exposure, (2) to identify thematic commonalities among these other events, and (3) to assess the prevalence of provisional lifetime and past month PTSD associated with these other events.<b>Method</b>: We used a parallel mixed methods approach and data from 2653 women in the Nurses' Health Study II to categorize 'other' events reported in free text and named as participants' 'worst' traumatic event. We assessed the prevalence of provisional lifetime and past month PTSD based on DSM-5 criteria associated with these 'worst' events.<b>Results</b>: 'Other' events fell into six thematic categories: non-violent death of a family member or close friend, distressing event occurring in the workplace, a family member being harmed in some way, a family member managing a distressing problem, problems with an intimate partner, or a personally distressing event/ problem. 'Other' event themes, such as a family member managing a problem distressing to the participant, were associated with high prevalence of provisional lifetime PTSD (33.7%; <i>n</i> = 101). Common 'other' events (within themes) were also associated with high provisional lifetime PTSD (e.g. verbal abuse or harassment, 43.8%; <i>n</i> = 89).<b>Conclusions</b>: Results suggest that events not typically defined as trauma may still be associated with clinically significant PTSD symptoms. Future studies should further investigate these events and consider including additional events to capture the range of clinically relevant experiences in research.",

      "title": "Applications of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder.",
      "abstract": "The application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in diagnosing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represents a significant research focus, providing deeper insights into trauma-related psychological disorders. PTSD often arises from chronic stress, a state in which the body struggles to adapt to overwhelming stimuli. Patients frequently experience persistent flashbacks (intrusive memories or sensory recollections of the traumatic event) and nightmares, which evoke intense emotional responses and disrupt daily life. These recurring episodes of stress and anxiety severely impact behavior and functioning. Understanding the brain changes associated with PTSD has become possible through advancements in MRI studies. This article aims to review the scientific literature on the use of magnetic resonance imaging techniques in diagnosing posttraumatic stress disorder. The review is based on scientific literature from medical databases, including Web of Science and Scopus, covering publications up to October 30, 2024. The findings from this analysis may contribute to a better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PTSD.",

      "title": "The relationships of adverse childhood experiences, recent negative events, past time perspective, and posttraumatic stress symptoms among emerging adults.",
      "abstract": "Past time perspective reflects concentration on past events and situations, which could affect the relationship between past adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Thus, this study aimed to examine the mediating role of past time perspective as moderated by recent negative events in the link between ACEs and PTSS among emerging adults. Using a longitudinal research design in the Chinese college population (<i>n</i> = 585, 18-25 years, 73.5% females), the study investigated (a) the mediating role of past time perspectives in the ACEs-PTSS link and (b) the moderating effects of negative life events in the ACEs-PTSS link via past time perspectives. ACEs were positively associated with PTSS via higher past negative time perspectives and that negative life events moderated both the direct effect of ACE on PTSS and its mediation effect via past negative time perspectives. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of negative life events have a stronger direct effect of ACEs on PTSS but less indirect effect of ACEs on PTSS through past negative time perspectives. These findings demonstrate the importance of examining both the mediating and moderating mechanisms that underlie the relationship between ACEs and PTSS. Such knowledge can inform interventions that target individuals under different stress levels to prevent PTSS. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "Serious medical events are increasingly recognised as potential triggers for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This systematic review evaluated the efficacy of interventions for medically induced PTSD. Nine electronic databases were searched from inception to November 2023 (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024504055). Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of interventions for adults diagnosed with, or exhibiting elevated symptoms of, PTSD related to life-threatening medical events. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. Group differences at follow-up were assessed using independent <i>t</i>-tests for statistical significance, and Cohen's <i>d</i> was calculated to measure effect sizes. Eleven trials (sample sizes: 17-89) met inclusion criteria, with PTSD primarily resulting from cardiovascular events (<i>n</i> = 5) or cancer (<i>n</i> = 4). Interventions included trauma-focused psychotherapies (<i>n</i> = 8; e.g., Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing [EMDR]) and others (<i>n</i> = 3; e.g., supportive therapy). Most studies reported significant posttreatment differences and large effect sizes favouring the intervention group, with EMDR and other trauma-focused psychotherapies particularly well-supported. Common limitations included small sample sizes, use of self-reported outcomes, and high dropout rates. Results highlight the efficacy of several interventions for medically induced PTSD and the need for larger trials.",
