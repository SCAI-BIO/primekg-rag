      "abstract": "Panic disorder is a common mental disease with high psychiatric comorbidity. It is considered that a combination of genetic predisposition and a special psychic vulnerability plays a key role in the occurrence of panic disorder. Clinically proven efficacy in the treatment of panic disorder have benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; antidepressants from other pharmaceutical groups are also used. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the first line medicines in the treatment of panic disorder. Atypical antipsychotics may be used for the therapy augmentation in addition to first line drugs. Psychotherapy is used along with medications, and a combination of pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy is the best method of treatment.",

      "title": "Panic disorder and suicide.",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder (PD) may increase the likelihood of suicidal ideation and behaviors because of psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder (MDD). However, research has yet to demonstrate a direct relationship between PD and suicide mortality. Using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 171,737 individuals with PD and 686,948 age- and sex-matched individuals without PD during 2003-2017. We assessed the risk of suicide within the same period. Psychiatric comorbidities such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), autism, alcohol use disorder (AUD), and substance use disorder (SUD) were also evaluated. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to compare the risk of suicide in different groups after adjustment for demographic data and psychiatric comorbidities. Our Cox regression model revealed that PD was an independent risk factor for suicide (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59-2.14), regardless of psychiatric comorbidities. Among all comorbidities, MDD with PD was associated with the highest risk of suicide (HR = 6.08, 95% CI = 5.48-6.74), followed by autism (HR = 4.52, 95% CI = 1.66-12.29), schizophrenia (HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.7-4.13), bipolar disorder (HR = 3.20, 95% CI = 2.71-3.79), AUD (HR = 2.99, 95% CI = 2.41-3.72), SUD (HR = 2.82, 95% CI = 2.28-3.47), and OCD (HR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.64-2.67). PD is an independent risk factor for suicide. Psychiatric comorbidities (i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, MDD, OCD, AUD, SUD, and autism) with PD increase the risk of suicide.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent panic attacks, with a prevalence of ~ 4% in the general population, causing heavy personal and socioeconomic burdens. The similarities of animal defense responses to clinical panic attack symptoms in humans make it possible to translate neuroanatomical pathways identified in animal studies to panic disorder in humans. Therefore, in this review we first present a basic overview of panic disorder in humans including the main subtypes, models commonly used to trigger panic attacks, related hypotheses, the neurotransmitter systems that may be involved, and the current clinical treatments to give the reader a comprehensive understanding of panic disorder. The animal section introduces the models that trigger panic-like behavior in animals and the brain regions that may be involved, providing insights for future elucidation of the neural circuit mechanisms behind panic attacks.",

      "title": "Panic attack provocation in panic disorder patients with a computer simulation.",
      "abstract": "Computer simulations (CS) and virtual reality exposure are promising techniques for research and treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA). The objective of this study was to ascertain whether a given CS was a stimulus capable of producing panic attacks (PAs), anxiety and psychophysiological changes in patients with PDA. Thirty PDA patients and 30 healthy subjects were recruited for this study. Subjects were exposed to a 3-min CS of a situation relevant to agoraphobic patients. Anxiety, panic symptoms, PAs, heart rate, skin conductance and respiration were recorded before, during and after the CS exposure. The CS effectively induced anxiety, hyperventilation and electrodermal responses in PDA patients but not in healthy subjects. Forty percent of PDA patients had a PA while none of the control subjects had a PA. A subgroup of patients who were less sensitive to the CS than the other subgroup of PDA patients and did not present full-blown PAs still had more panic symptoms, higher anxiety levels and more respiratory irregularities than the controls. Low immersion and low sense of presence, lack of interaction with the environment. Exposure to the CS produced effects similar to in vivo exposure, respiratory and caffeine challenges. Subsequent studies should: make direct comparisons between CS and other challenges for PDA; investigate if CS can be a tool for predicting effects of medication; determine the potential of CS as a desensitization technique for situational PAs.",

      "title": "Approaches to panic attack symptoms in cardiology outpatients.",
      "abstract": "Cardiologists' attitudes towards the patients with panic attack (PA) symptoms can be affected by many variables. This study was aimed to examine the practices and attitudes of cardiologists actively practicing in Turkey through an internet-based survey. An internet-based, cross-sectional, and observational survey was administered to actively practicing adult cardiologists. The sample size was calculated (minimum 135 participants). The survey draft was created by the conductor of the study and the final version of the survey items was decided by psychiatrists and cardiologists. Cronbach's alpha based on standardized items of the survey in the pilot (0.747) and final samples (0.742) was calculated. The survey, which included the characteristics on the landing page, was delivered to participants working in the Turkey via WhatsApp and Yahoo groups. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.0. Ethical approval and informed consent was obtained. One hundred forty-five participants (87 males (60.00%) and 58 females (40.00%); 89 cardiology resident (61.37%) and 56 cardiology specialist (38.63%)) were included in the study. In patients presenting with symptoms of PA, when no cardiac/organic etiology was detected, 83 (57.24%) of the cardiologists directly referred the patients to psychiatry, while 62 (42.76%) of them started the treatment themselves. The most common symptom in patients presenting with non-cardiac PA symptoms was palpitations (86.20%). The number of cardiologists who had experience in starting escitalopram with a preliminary diagnosis of panic disorder (PD) was 50 (31.00%). Forty-three (29.7%) of cardiologists thought that antidepressants (ADs) were addictive. Thirty-five (24.1%) of cardiologists thought that ADs caused forgetfulness. According to 61 cardiologists, ADs should be used in the morning, while according to 64 cardiologists, ADs should be used in the evening. Forty-four (30.3%) cardiologists did not think benzodiazepines were addictive. The number of cardiologists who thought that patients who admitted to any physician other than cardiology with PA symptoms should be routinely referred to cardiology was 71 (49.00%). The difference between PA and PD was not known to any of the participants (n = 145). While gender had a limited effect on the findings, it was found that being cardiology specialist or not had a significant relationship with many variables. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to predict approach in the presence of non-cardiac PA symptoms and five variables (specialization status, routine echocardiogram examination, minimum usage time of ADs, association of ADs with addiction, and routine cardiology consultation by a non-cardiologist) were included given their contribution to the model (sensitivity = 86.70%, specificity = 83.90%; Beginning block - 2 Log likelihood 197.961; Block one - 2 Log likelihood 100.083<sup>a</sup>, Cox & Snell R<sup>2</sup> = 0.491, Nagelkerke R<sup>2</sup> = 0.659; Hosmer and Lemeshow Test p value 0.254; constant p = 0.001). Non-cardiac PA symptoms are detected in approximately one sixth of those who apply to cardiology outpatient clinics, and it is recommended that cardiologists refer these patients to psychiatry to be evaluated for PD and receive appropriate treatment. PD treatment is a teamwork, and collaboration between cardiology and psychiatry is an integral part of this process.",

      "title": "Panic Disorder in Primary Care.",
      "abstract": "We evaluated a team-based program of exercises for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PDA) in primary care. 419 patients with PDA (mean age 46.2 years, standard deviation 14.4 years; 74% female) were included in this cluster-randomized, controlled intervention trial. The patients were blinded with respect to their group assignment at baseline. Patients in the intervention group (36 primary-care practices, 230 patients) underwent a 23-week exercise program combined with case management, while patients in the control group (37 practices, 189 patients) received standard care. Symptoms of anxiety (according to the Beck Anxiety Inventory, BAI) at six months were the primary endpoint. Patients were followed up at six months (n = 338, 81%) and at twelve months (n = 318, 76%). The analysis was by intention to treat. Symptoms of anxiety improved to a significantly greater extent in the intervention group (p = 0.008). The intergroup dif- ference in the reduction of the BAI score (range: 0-63) was 3.0 points (95% confidence interval [-5.8; -0.2]) at six months and 4.0 points [-6.9; -1.2] at twelve months. In the intervention group, there was a significantly greater reduction in the frequency of panic attacks (p = 0.019), in avoidant behavior (p = 0.016), and in depressiveness (p<0.001), as well as a greater improvement of the quality of treatment (p<0.001). In primary-care patients who have panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, a team-based exercise program combined with case management can improve symptoms to a greater extent than standard primary-care treatment.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of panic disorder (PD) in the population is high and these patients have work impairment, high unemployment rates, seek medical treatment more frequently and have more hospitalizations than people without panic symptoms. Despite the availability of pharmacological, psychological and combined treatments, approximately one-third of all PD patients have persistent panic attacks and other PD symptoms after treatment. MEDLINE/Pubmed, CENTRAL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical trials in treatment-resistant PD. Only studies published between 1980 and 2015, in English, with human subjects, considered \"journal articles\" and clinical trial were included. We included trials recruiting only adult subjects with treatment-resistant PD, consistent with criteria from DSM-III to DSM5. We included all prospective experimental studies. Case, case series, retrospective studies or studies with <10 PD subjects were not included. Only 11 articles were included in this review. There were few quality studies, only two were randomized, controlled and double blind. Augmentation of the pharmacological treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy demonstrated some short-term efficacy in treatment-resistant PD. There were also preliminary evidences of efficacy for monotherapy with reboxetine and olanzapine, and augmentation with pindolol, divalproex sodium, aripiprazole and olanzapine in short-term treatment.",

      "title": "Panic disorder in epilepsy.",
      "abstract": "A 51-year-old woman showed structural epilepsy following an atypical, nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal area. Despite successful seizure control with lamotrigine, she developed severe morning anxiety and panic attacks, leading to agoraphobia, social withdrawal, and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. Neuropsychiatric and psychological assessments confirmed an anxiety disorder with no significant symptoms of depression. The patient received various psychopharmacological treatments with limited success. This case report illustrates that managing panic disorder in patients with structural epilepsy requires a comprehensive treatment approach that includes pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Differential diagnosis and accurate treatment are crucial because of the symptom overlap between panic attacks and <i>peri</i>-ictal fear. Screenings instruments such as the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) can aid in assessing anxiety-related symptoms. First-line pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, especially sertraline, or venlafaxine can effectively reduce panic attacks and can be recommended in patients with epilepsy. Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy, is the treatment of choice. Referral to a psychiatrist is indicated when symptoms are severe or refractory to treatment.",

      "title": "Fear Circuits in Panic Disorder: An Update.",
      "abstract": "Findings from animal models have been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms and etiology of panic disorder (PD); nonetheless, several aspects of its neurobiological underpinnings remain to be fully clarified. This review aims to consolidate current understanding and recent advances in the neuroanatomical and pathophysiological basis of PD. A narrative review was conducted, drawing on recent literature addressing the neurobiology and neuroanatomy of PD, with a particular focus on fear circuits as elucidated by both preclinical and clinical studies. This updated review further delineates the fear circuitry implicated in PD, emphasizing the roles of the amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, insula, and prefrontal cortex in the mediation of pathological fear responses. Continued research involving human populations is essential to refine current models of fear circuitry in PD. Such efforts may yield critical insights that support the development of evidence-based therapeutic strategies aimed at re-establishing disrupted homeostatic processes that have been disrupted by the activation of the brain's fear circuitry.",
