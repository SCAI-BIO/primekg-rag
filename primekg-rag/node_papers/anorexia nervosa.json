      "title": "Medical Complications of Anorexia Nervosa.",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the most prevalent eating disorder, affecting almost 3 million people and having the highest mortality rate among psychiatric conditions. The hypometabolic state in AN, caused by an imbalance between energy intake and needs, leads to various medical complications, including gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular abnormalities, hematologic alterations, neurocognitive impairment, low bone mineral density, electrolyte imbalances, nephrological issues, and dermatological lesions. Some of these complications are life-threatening, necessitating prompt recognition and treatment by pediatricians and psychiatrists. Indeed, the unfavorable outcome of AN is primarily due to medical and psychiatric comorbidities; approximately one-third of deaths in cases with AN are attributed to cardiovascular complications. Hematological alterations and symptoms of medical instability, such as bradycardia, hypotension, orthostasis, and electrolyte derangements, occur in 1 out of 5 youths with AN requiring hospitalization, with nearly 40% needing repeated hospitalizations. Prompt comprehensive medical, psychiatric, and nutritional assessments, along with thorough physical examinations and laboratory tests, are crucial for early identification and management of these complications. Immediate hospitalization is essential in life-threatening cases to prevent further clinical deterioration or manage the suicide risk. This article reviews the acute and chronic medical consequences of AN, divided into common and rare, focusing on children and adolescents and summarizing the complications by organ/system and frequency.",

      "title": "Anorexia Nervosa-Facts, Frustrations, and the Future.",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a prevalent psychiatric illness associated with exceptionally poor outcomes, including high rates of morbidity and premature mortality. Current evidence-based treatments for anorexia nervosa were developed several decades ago and have limited efficacy. The anorexia nervosa field-and the eating disorders field more broadly-has yet to make significant scientific breakthroughs that lead to acceptable outcomes for people with anorexia nervosa. This Special Communication highlights how the concurrent psychological and physical symptoms of anorexia nervosa contribute to 2 major problems that have held the anorexia nervosa research field back and hindered research innovations: (1) overspecialization and siloing of the field and (2) an overly narrow focus on weight restoration in treatment. Specific recommendations are made to help progress the field, including taking a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach to research with colleagues from related disciplines, as well as taking a more holistic approach to understanding and treating anorexia nervosa.",

      "title": "The Thorny Issue of Atypical Anorexia Nervosa: Clinicians' Perspectives on How It Should Be Defined.",
      "abstract": "Atypical Anorexia Nervosa (AAN) is an ill-defined diagnosis. Little is known about how eating disorder clinicians perceive the utility of the diagnosis, and what changes they believe would add to that utility. This qualitative study aimed to explore clinicians' perspectives on refining the DSM-5 AAN diagnosis. Content analysis of text was used to categorise 47 responses to the questions: \"What changes are required to the DSM-5 definition of AAN?\", and \"How do you think significant weight loss should be defined?\". Over 27% of clinicians advocated removing the AAN diagnosis or combining it with Anorexia Nervosa, while nearly 15% reported concerns about the requirement for 'significant weight loss'. Over 87% of clinicians suggested ways (often inconsistent across clinicians) to define 'significant weight loss', with emphasis on the need for a specified rate (i.e., amount of loss/time) and consideration of physical health impacts. Clinicians broadly agree that revisions are necessary to the current AAN definition. However, while some propose specific modifications (e.g., defining 'significant weight loss'), others advocate for the complete removal of the diagnosis. The breadth of suggestions for how to define 'significant weight loss' highlights the ongoing lack of consensus on AAN's relevance as a diagnostic entity.",

      "title": "A case report of anorexia nervosa in a 23-year-old Ethiopian woman.",
      "abstract": "Limited studies on AN in Africa, including Ethiopia. Internet and media have changed body image portrayal in developing countries. A need for a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, training on positive coaching styles, and future research. The Global Burden of Disease had estimated anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia nervosa to be 13.6 million people. The lifetime prevalence of AN ranges from 2.4 to 4.3 percent. During their lifetime, up to 4% of females and up to 0.3% of males suffer from anorexia nervosa. Studies assessing AN in Africa, including Ethiopia, are limited. This case report describes a 23-year-old female patient who presented with anorectic symptoms and signs in Ethiopia. This case report describes a 23-year-old female patient who participated in sports activities. She had a low body weight based on a BMI of 13.15 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and lost around 10 kg within the past 6 months. She feared gaining weight or becoming fat, thus restricting food intake. The findings on psychiatric evaluation encompassing detailed history and mental state examination suggested the diagnosis of Extreme anorexia nervosa, restricting type; adult malnutrition; major depressive disorder (MDD) (in remission); low risk of aggression; low risk of suicide; severe functional impairment. The general management principles implemented in this patient included assessment of medical complications, weight restoration, psychological intervention, medication for comorbid depression, and long-term psychological and biological treatment follow-up to avoid relapse. The presented case of a 23-year-old Ethiopian female patient who is athletic shows weight-controlled sports activities and the manifestation of anorexia nervosa. Easy access to the Internet and media has changed body image portrayal in developing countries including Ethiopia. There is a need for a multidisciplinary approach involving psychiatrists, psychologists, internists, and nutritionists for the management of AN. The early screening and management of medical complications are crucial. There is a need for close monitoring of vital signs, restriction of caffeine, excess fluid, and salt, and limiting excessive exercise. Furthermore, to assess micronutrient deficiencies, vitamin supplements should be prescribed in the form of multivitamin and thiamine preparations. The need for future training about positive coaching styles for coaches is mandatory to reduce the future impacts on young athletes. There is a need for future research on eating disorders in developing countries such as Ethiopia.",

      "title": "Mentalizing ability in acute and remitted anorexia nervosa.",
      "abstract": "Mentalizing refers to an individual's capacity for inferring intentions, thoughts, and emotions from verbal and nonverbal cues. Impairments in mentalizing are well established in anorexia nervosa (AN). It is unclear, however, whether these deficits only occur in the acute phases of AN (state-like), or if deficits remain once remission has been achieved (trait-like). The current study aimed to determine the predictive value of the severity of AN in determining the severity of mentalizing deficits and whether mentalizing differs in acute and recovered stages of AN. The final sample comprised of 161 participants aged 18-30. Participants were allocated to the acute-AN group (BMI under 17, <i>n</i> = 15), remission-AN group (BMI over 17 with previous history of AN, <i>n</i> = 64) or the general population control group (no history of AN, <i>n</i> = 82). Participants provided demographic information and completed a battery of online tests and surveys. No significant differences were found on mentalizing between the acute and remission groups. The control group demonstrated significantly better mentalizing than the remission-AN group. Severity of AN (measured by BMI) was a significant predictor of mentalizing when measured objectively but not subjectively. The findings suggest no categorical improvement in mentalizing following remission and demonstrated mentalizing improvements as BMI increased, suggesting mentalizing deficits may be trait-based and observable in AN regardless of stage of illness.",

      "abstract": "In this special issue, international researchers investigate how atypical anorexia nervosa (atypical AN) differs from anorexia nervosa (AN) and other eating disorders with respect to demographics, psychological and physiological morbidity, as well as treatment course and outcome. Manuscripts in this special issue report that atypical AN is associated with substantial medical and psychological morbidity, and the majority of studies find few differences between atypical AN and AN. While much remains to be learned about the long-term course and treatment response of individuals with atypical AN to psychological and pharmacological interventions, the evidence supports conceptualization of atypical AN as part of a spectrum-based restrictive eating disorder. These findings together with the potentially stigmatizing use of the term \"atypical\" suggest it may be time to revise the existing definition of atypical AN.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in anorexia nervosa.",
      "abstract": "Sleep is crucial for physical and psychological health, and disturbances are closely linked to psychiatric disorders, making their management essential for improving treatment outcomes and preventing relapse. Although sleep disturbances are implicated in psychopathology of eating disorders, its role in anorexia nervosa (AN) remains unclear. This review aimed to characterise sleep in AN. A systematic search was conducted in four scientific databases, including papers from inception to 25 May 2024. A machine learning algorithm (ASReview) was utilised to screen titles and abstracts for eligibility. Sleep quantity, architecture, and quality were investigated. Meta-analyses were conducted to investigate the difference between patients with AN and healthy controls (HC) in total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency, Sleep Stage 1, 2, slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and REM latency. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Out of 67 potentially eligible papers, 31 were included in this review, with 15 in the meta-analyses. Statistically significant average mean differences were found for TST (-32.1 min [95% CI: -50.9, -13.4]), WASO (19.0 min [95% CI: -2.4, 40.3]), and sleep efficiency (-4.4% [95% CI: -7.9, -0.9]). Additionally, Sleep stage 1 was significantly increased (2.4% [95%-CI: 0.05, 4.7]), while REM sleep was reduced (-2.1% [95%-CI: -4.2, -0.02]). Subgroup analysis showed that TST and WASO did not improve significantly after weight restoration. Sleep in patients with AN is impaired, with lower TST and sleep efficiency, higher WASO, more time in stage 1 sleep, and less in REM. Weight restoration alone may not improve sleep. While more research is needed, substantial accompanying sleep disturbances in AN justifies addressing these in current treatment practice, also because of the chronic character of AN and importance of sleep for long term (mental) health.",
