      "abstract": "This contribution addresses the agoraphobic syndrome in several important ways. Tracing the different formulations of agoraphobia reveals shifts in psychoanalytic theorizing. The etiology and maintenance of agoraphobia includes the role of genetic factors, intra- and interpersonal dynamics, and the influence of social conditions. As such, an understanding and treatment of agoraphobia requires a multimodal and interdisciplinary approach.",

      "title": "Clinical implications of agoraphobia in patients with panic disorder.",
      "abstract": "Agoraphobia is frequently accompanied by panic disorder and causes considerable suffering. The aim of this study was to compare clinical features and treatment courses between patients with and without agoraphobia in panic disorder.In this retrospective study, 87 patients with panic disorder were divided into two groups depending on the presence of agoraphobia: patients with agoraphobia (PDA, n = 41) and patients without agoraphobia (PD, n = 46). Agoraphobia subscale score of the Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire was used to identify correlations between agoraphobia and panic and affective symptoms.The PDA group showed more severe panic and affective symptoms than the PD group. Patients with PDA were more likely to be younger at the age of onset, take benzodiazepines for longer durations, and be treated with antipsychotics augmentation. Agoraphobia subscale was associated with panic symptoms, depression, anxiety, and the duration of benzodiazepines use.The findings suggest that patients with PDA experienced more severe panic symptoms, more profound psychiatric comorbidity, and worse illness progression than those with PD.",

      "title": "The Oxford Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale.",
      "abstract": "Agoraphobic avoidance of everyday situations is a common feature in many mental health disorders. Avoidance can be due to a variety of fears, including concerns about negative social evaluation, panicking, and harm from others. The result is inactivity and isolation. Behavioural avoidance tasks (BATs) provide an objective assessment of avoidance and <i>in situ</i> anxiety but are challenging to administer and lack standardisation. Our aim was to draw on the principles of BATs to develop a self-report measure of agoraphobia symptoms. The scale was developed with 194 patients with agoraphobia in the context of psychosis, 427 individuals in the general population with high levels of agoraphobia, and 1094 individuals with low levels of agoraphobia. Factor analysis, item response theory, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were used. Validity was assessed against a BAT, actigraphy data, and an existing agoraphobia measure. Test-retest reliability was assessed with 264 participants. An eight-item questionnaire with avoidance and distress response scales was developed. The avoidance and distress scales each had an excellent model fit and reliably assessed agoraphobic symptoms across the severity spectrum. All items were highly discriminative (avoidance: <i>a</i> = 1.24-5.43; distress: <i>a</i> = 1.60-5.48), indicating that small increases in agoraphobic symptoms led to a high probability of item endorsement. The scale demonstrated good internal reliability, test-retest reliability, and validity. The Oxford Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale has excellent psychometric properties. Clinical cut-offs and score ranges are provided. This precise assessment tool may help focus attention on the clinically important problem of agoraphobic avoidance.",

      "title": "Agoraphobia Related to Unassertiveness in Panic Disorder.",
      "abstract": "Despite developments in panic disorder (PD) research, a significant percentage of patients do not benefit from conventional treatments. Interpersonal factors have been identified as potential predictors of treatment failures. We aimed to evaluate assertiveness in a sample of patients with PD and its implications for treatment. Forty-six symptomatic patients with PD and 46 college students responded to assessment scales regarding assertiveness and clinical data. Seventy-five percent of the patients had a secondary diagnosis of agoraphobia. We found that the PD group was characterized as nonassertive and slightly less assertive than control subjects. Furthermore, the deficit in the level of assertiveness correlated with the severity of the PD. The diagnosis of agoraphobia was correlated with unassertiveness (p < 0.05). Agoraphobia predisposes individuals to dependency and insecurity about their ability to overcome anxiogenic situations. These data demonstrate the importance of managing assertiveness in patients with PD accompanied by agoraphobia.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the course of agoraphobia with panic disorder combined with the major depressive disorder to establish positive and negative prevalence predictors. The sample consisted of 49 women. The average age was 41.5±9.9 years. All patients (<i>n</i>=49; 100%) had symptoms of agoraphobia with panic disorder (F40.01) (<i>n</i>=49; 100%) and recurrent depressive disorder with mild (F33.01) (<i>n</i>=33; 67.3%) or moderate (F33.11) (<i>n</i>=16; 32.7%) severity. The duration of the disease by the time of inclusion in the study was from 2 to 5 years. Clinical-psychopathological, clinical-follow-up, clinical-dynamic, and statistical methods were used. Two types of agoraphobia prevalence with panic disorder were identified. Type I is a relatively favorable one with complete remissions of phobic anxiety and affective disorders (<i>n</i>=29; 59.2%). Type II is an unfavorable one with constant phobic anxiety symptoms (<i>n</i>=20; 40.8%). The predictive factors of the unfavorable type of agoraphobia with panic disorder (APD) combined with depression were psychogenic situations, astheno-vegetative disorders at the onset of APD, gastrointestinal symptoms, senestopathy, fear of going crazy, or loss of control in the structure of a panic attack (PA), morning PA, vertebral artery syndrome, diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, panic attacks with provocation, depression with hysteroform symptoms in pre-manifest period APD, the age at the time of the debut APD, professional status, occupational psychogenic, family microclimate, health problems, endocrine system diseases, severe agoraphobia.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the current study was to compare the 20-year outcome in panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD with AG) and agoraphobia without panic disorder (AG without PD) patients after inpatient psychological treatment. Of 53 eligible patients having completed a medication-free integrated exposure and psychodynamic treatment, 38 (71.7%)-25 PD with AG and 13 AG without PD patients-attended 20-year follow-up. AG without PD patients improved less than PD with AG patients did on primary outcome measures. In the PD with AG group, there were large uncontrolled effect sizes (<-2.30). More of the AG without PD patients had avoidant personality disorder at pretreatment, but the presence of this disorder did not predict outcome. The follow-up results support that PD with AG and AG without PD are two different disorders. The results also suggest that the very long-term outcome in PD with AG patients is excellent for this integrated treatment.",

      "abstract": "Although exposure in vivo is considered to be the most effective therapy component in the treatment of agoraphobia (AG), there is a remarkable lack of its application in psychotherapeutic routine care. We examined the severity of anxiety, psychological distress/comorbidity, therapeutic process/alliance, and sociodemographic status as potential predictors of in vivo exposure. We applied correlational analyses and logistic regression analyses in a sample of N = 92 patients (main diagnosis AG) in an outpatient setting. Logistic regression analyses did not yield any significant single predictors, whereas a combination of a subset of predictors significantly predicted the application of exposure in vivo in the completer sample (R<sup>2</sup> = .24, p = .041). The application of in vivo exposure may be predicted by a complex pattern of patient characteristics.",

      "title": "Examination of metacognitions and functionality in agoraphobia without comorbidities.",
      "abstract": "Although agoraphobia is considered an independent diagnosis, the literature is limited in studies examining it alone. This study aims to investigate the relationship between agoraphobia, metacognitive beliefs, and functionality and to increase interest in studies on agoraphobia by contributing to areas that are missing in the literature. Seventy healthy controls without any psychiatric disorder and seventy individuals with agoraphobia without comorbidities were included in the study. Data regarding sociodemographic characteristics, agoraphobic symptoms, metacognitive beliefs, functionality, depression, and anxiety levels were collected from the participants. Comparisons were made between the groups. Mediation analysis was performed by adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables to determine the mediating role of metacognitions in the effect of agoraphobia severity on functionality. The agoraphobia group scored significantly higher than controls on pathological metacognitive beliefs, anxiety, and depression measures (p < 0.05), and showed more severe impairment in all functional domains (p < 0.05). Metacognitive belief levels were positively correlated (p < 0.001) with agoraphobia severity (r = 0.570) and functional impairment (r = 0.537). Mediation analysis indicated that metacognitive beliefs significantly mediated the impact of agoraphobia severity on functionality, accounting for approximately 26% of the total effect. Metacognitive beliefs mediated the relationship between the severity of agoraphobia and functional impairment (mediation effect accounting for 26%). Metacognitive processes play a key role in how agoraphobia severity translates into functional impairment. Targeting dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs in treatment may improve functional outcomes in agoraphobia. These findings highlight the need for further longitudinal and experimental studies focusing on agoraphobia without comorbid conditions.",
