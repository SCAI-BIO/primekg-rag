      "abstract": "In the clinical assessment of alcohol use disorder (AUD), measuring tools are essential to help recognizing the condition, determining the severity of the disorder, and assessing craving and relapse after identifying potential complications. Currently, there are no measurement tools available in Hungary that can quantify the severity of alcohol dependence, the extent of alcohol craving, and the risk of relapse, or help in the early detection of complicated alcohol withdrawal syndrome (c-AWS). There for the aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric indicators of the Hungarian versions of the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SAD-Q), Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS), Multidimensional Alcohol Craving Scale (MACS), Alcohol Relapse Risk Scale (ARRS), and the Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS). The present study was conducted among patients (n = 44) admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, University of Szeged with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, or alcohol withdrawal syndrome with delirium. In addition to the aforementioned questionnaires, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were administered. Internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's alpha, item-total correlation) and convergent validity indices (Spearman correlations) were calculated, Mann-Whitney test was used to assess differences in the risk of relapse for the ARRS total score, and the independent-sample t-test was used to explore differences in complicated and non- complicated withdrawal for the PAWSS total score. In addition, binomial logistic regression was performed for both scales to analyze whether total scores were good predictors of c-AWS and relapse. Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.875 to 0.948, and the construct validity indices (Spearman correlations) ranged from 0.537 to 0.760. For the ARRS, significantly higher total scores were found for those who relapsed within 3 months, and for the PAWSS, significantly higher total scores were found for patients experiencing complicated withdrawal. The ARRS and PAWSS total scores are good predictors of relapse and c-AWS. Based on our results, the questionnaires listed are reliable and valid measuring instruments, and their use might facilitate a more modern investigation and treatment of AUD.",

      "title": "Imaging Manifestations of Alcohol Use-associated Disorders and Diseases.",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a serious condition linked to multiple health issues such as nervous system damage, heart disease, alcoholic liver disease, development of cancers, fetal alcohol syndrome, mental health disorders, and injuries to self and others. AUD presents a growing problem worldwide with significant economic and health care costs. Despite its growing prevalence, AUD remains underdiagnosed, partly due to the underreporting of alcohol intake and the stigma associated with the diagnosis. While traditionally diagnosed through clinical evaluation and patient history, diagnosis of AUD-related disorders and diseases can be significantly aided by advanced imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, and US, allowing detection at an earlier stage. Early detection through imaging may allow timely intervention and treatment, potentially preventing further damage to organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas, mitigating the risk of serious complications and improving overall health outcomes. Radiologists play a key role by recognizing the imaging signatures of AUD, enabling them to flag potential issues early on. The authors highlight how imaging aids in diagnosing AUD-related conditions, including alcohol-related central nervous system disorders, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, alcoholic liver disease at various stages from hepatic steatosis to cirrhosis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal manifestations, fetal alcohol syndrome leading to birth defects, musculoskeletal manifestations, and increased risk of certain cancers. By understanding these imaging signatures, radiologists can contribute to accurate diagnoses and effective treatment plans, ultimately improving patient outcomes. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has devastating effects, and its prevalence in the US is growing. It is therefore important to examine multiple avenues for successful cessation and continued abstinence. Disulfiram, oral naltrexone, naltrexone IM, and acamprosate are currently the only four medications approved for the treatment of AUD by the FDA. This review aims to examine the efficacy of the approved medications as well as explore the use of off-label pharmacologic treatments used for AUD treatment (including gabapentin, baclofen, oxytocin, N-acetylcysteine, calcium carbonate, and psilocybin). Through this exploration, the most effective treatment for individuals with AUD can be determined to enable providers in ameliorating the prevalence of this disease.",

      "title": "Alcohol use disorder criteria exhibit different comorbidity patterns.",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder is comorbid with numerous other forms of psychopathology, including externalizing disorders (e.g. conduct disorder) and, to a lesser extent, internalizing conditions (e.g. depression, anxiety). Much of the time, overlap among alcohol use disorder and other conditions is explored at the disorder level, assuming that criteria are co-equal indicators of other psychopathology, even though alcohol use disorder criteria span numerous varied domains. Emerging evidence suggests that there are symptom clusters within the construct of alcohol use disorder that relate differentially with important external criteria, including psychopathology and allied personality traits (e.g. impulsivity, novelty-seeking). The present study mapped individual alcohol use disorder criteria onto internalizing and externalizing dimensions. We used multivariate and factor analytical modeling and data from two large nationally representative samples of past year drinkers (n = 25 604; 19 454). United States. Psychopathology was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule, yielding alcohol use disorder criteria, internalizing diagnoses (i.e. major depressive disorder, dysthymia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia and panic disorder) and externalizing diagnoses and symptoms (i.e. antisocial personality disorder, conduct disorder and three impulsivity items drawn from borderline personality disorder criteria). Alcohol consumption was assessed in terms of past-year drinking frequency, usual amount of alcohol consumed on drinking days, binge drinking frequency, intoxication frequency, and maximum number of drinks in a 24-hour period. Four different patterns emerged. First, several alcohol use disorder criteria were relatively weakly associated with externalizing and internalizing. Secondly, withdrawal was associated with internalizing, but this association was not specific to distress. Thirdly, there was a general lack of specificity between alcohol use disorder criteria and narrower forms of internalizing, despite what might be predicted by modern models of addiction. Fourthly, recurrent use in hazardous situations reflected higher degrees of externalizing and lower internalizing liability. Different symptom combinations appear to yield differential expressions of alcohol use disorder that are disorder-specific, or reflect broader tendencies toward externalizing, internalizing or both.",

      "title": "Alcohol use disorder exacerbates clinical and vascular risks differentially in psychiatric disorders.",
      "abstract": "Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a major public health concern with detrimental effects on cognitive and neurological function, yet its impact on psychiatric populations remains incompletely defined. In this global propensity score-matched cohort study, we examined the clinical and vascular consequences of comorbid alcohol abuse across diverse psychiatric disorders. Data from the TriNetX network, encompassing electronic medical records from 143 healthcare organizations, were analyzed. For each disorder-anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, reaction to severe stress, eating disorders, personality disorders, psychoactive substance dependence, developmental disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder-patients with alcohol abuse were matched 1:1 to those without, controlling for demographic and clinical factors. Over a 1095-day follow-up, outcomes evaluated included emergency department visits, pain prevalence, mortality, and cerebrovascular events (transient ischemic attacks and strokes). Alcohol abuse was consistently associated with significantly higher emergency care utilization, increased somatic pain, and elevated mortality across all groups. For instance, anxiety and depression cohorts exhibited 8.1% and 7.3% higher emergency visits and increased mortality by 2.7% and 2.4%, respectively, while schizophrenia showed a twofold increase in stroke risk and markedly higher pain (risk ratio 2.21). These results underscore that AUD exacerbates clinical and vascular risks in psychiatric patients, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions.",

      "title": "Relationship Between Problematic Alcohol Use and Various Psychiatric Disorders: A Genetically Informed Study.",
      "abstract": "Problematic alcohol use (PAU) adversely affects the clinical course of psychiatric disorders. Genetic studies have suggested that genetic factors underlie the co-occurrence of PAU with psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to elucidate shared genetic architectures, prioritizing genes that disorders may have in common. Using genome-wide association data of PAU including 435,563 samples from people of European ancestry, this study investigated the genetic relationship between PAU and 11 psychiatric disorders using a bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR). Local genetic correlation and colocalization analyses were conducted to identify the genomic regions significantly associated with PAU and each psychiatric disorder. Postanalysis included the false discovery rate (FDR) and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs), as well as summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to prioritize shared genes by integrating brain transcriptome data. MiXeR analysis revealed a substantial polygenic overlap (39%-73%) between PAU and psychiatric disorders. Four bivariate genomic regions with high correlations suggest shared causal variants of PAU with major depression and schizophrenia. Within these regions, four and six genes for the PAU-major depression and PAU-schizophrenia pairs, respectively, were mapped by conjunctional FDR analysis. Furthermore, <i>TTC12</i> and <i>ANKK1</i> were identified as potential causal genes for PAU and these disorders. The findings were replicated in multi-ancestry analyses of colocalization and TWASs. Despite the varying degrees of genetic overlap and directions of shared genetic effect correlations, these results imply the presence of shared genetic factors influencing the comorbidity of PAU and psychiatric disorders. Additionally, <i>TTC12</i> and <i>ANKK1</i>, located near <i>DRD2</i>, may be causally associated with comorbid conditions.",

      "title": "Modern pharmacotherapy guidance for treating alcohol use disorders.",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is prevalent and recognized as a chronic, relapsing disorder. Even though effective treatment options are available, AUD is strongly undertreated. As adjuvant treatment strategies accompanying psychosocial treatments, pharmacological strategies can increase the efficacy of AUD treatment options. After giving a brief update of epidemiology, neurobiology and treatment rationales for AUD, the review outlines pharmacological interventions against the background of current evidence. These include approved substances like naltrexone, nalmefene, acamprosate and disulfiram, second line medications like topiramate, baclofen and varenicline and novel approaches like hallucinogens. The review refers to the primary database on pharmacotherapies for AUD and to findings from pairwise and network meta-analyses. It illustrates effects of pharmacotherapies for AUD on different outcomes and assesses risks and benefits of treatment strategies. Search has been conducted in PubMed using the substance name or related categories (such as anti-craving or relapse prevention) as key words. Improved understanding of AUDs neurocircuitry expands the range of available pharmacotherapeutic strategies for supporting abstinence and drinking reduction. Pharmacotherapies for AUD can be improved by understanding differences in treatment response. Matching different treatment approaches to individual needs can challenge the view of alcohol dependence as a lifelong disorder.",

      "title": "Psychiatric comorbidity among alcohol-dependent individuals seeking treatment at the Alcohol Rehabilitation Unit, Stikland Hospital.",
      "abstract": "International studies have found high rates of psychiatric comorbidity among patients with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and highlighted the clinical and prognostic implications of this finding. There is a paucity of information with regard to the extent of this problem within the South African context. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity (DSM IV-TR) in treatment-seeking, alcohol-dependent South Africans. This study was conducted at the Alcohol Rehabilitation Unit (ARU), Stikland Hospital, Western Cape. This cross-sectional study was conducted over a 6-month period. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, version 5) was used to assess psychiatric comorbidity in 101 (male, <i>n</i> = 65; 64.5%) alcohol-dependent patients. Interviews were conducted after the first week of admission to ward 13. Most participants (<i>n</i> = 63, 62.4%) had a co-occurring psychiatric disorder, the most common being major depressive (<i>n</i> = 30, 29.7%) and anxiety disorders (<i>n</i> = 43, 42.6%). Of the anxiety disorders, agoraphobia without a history of panic disorder (<i>n</i> = 10, 9.9%) and social phobia (<i>n</i> = 10, 9.9%) occurred most frequently, followed by generalised anxiety disorder (<i>n</i> = 9, 8.9%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (<i>n</i> = 9, 8.9%). Thirteen patients (13%) had a comorbid substance use disorder other than AUD. The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity at this unit is high, especially among female patients. The findings emphasise a need to thoroughly assess patients and provide treatment and personnel who can manage the complex needs of a dual diagnosis patient population.",

      "title": "The alcohol use disorder treatment gap and its correlates among middle-aged and older adults.",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are under-treated, particularly among older adults. Using data from national treatment registers can expand knowledge on the AUD treatment rate among older adults and on potential biases in treatment receipt. The aim of this paper was to determine the AUD treatment prevalence rate and to investigate sociodemographic, health-related and substance use-related correlates of AUD treatment receipt among older adults with different degrees of problematic alcohol use. The study sample (n = 13,403; inclusion criteria: age 55-80 years, positive CAGE-C) is a subsample from the representative cross-sectional 2017 Danish National Health Survey. It was enriched with data from Danish National Registers, including the National Alcohol Treatment Database. Weighted 12-month AUD treatment prevalence rates were determined. Logistic regression analysis was applied to identify correlates of treatment receipt. All analyses were conducted among: (i) the study sample; (ii) the 28.9% with a positive original CAGE (n = 3725); and (iii) the 6.1% endorsing the CAGE's E-criterion (n = 692). The 12-month AUD treatment prevalence was 0.5% in the study sample, 1.6% in the CAGE-, and 3.8% in the E-criterion subsample. Not being married or partnered, loneliness and contacts with health care providers were positively associated with AUD treatment receipt in all three samples. Even in the subsample with putative alcohol withdrawal, the AUD treatment rate did not reach 5%. This finding suggests that putative AUD is significantly undertreated in older adults. Contacts with other health care providers may facilitate AUD treatment entry in this age group.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Research on sex differences in personality disorders profiles among individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) remains limited. This study aimed to examine sex differences in personality disorders in AUD individuals attending to an outpatient alcohol and drugs treatment unit. <b>Methods:</b> Persons seeking alcohol detoxification treatment were assessed with the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI-III) after abstinence. Both dimensional trait scores and cluster personality disorders types distribution were analyzed. A total of 216 subjects, 114 women (53%) and 102 men (47%), participated in the study. <b>Results:</b> No sex differences were found for paranoid, schizoid or schizotypal traits scores of Cluster A types. Women exhibited higher scores on the Cluster B histrionic trait (48 ± 22 vs. 39 ± 23, <i>p</i> = 0.012), with no differences in antisocial, borderline, or narcissistic trait scores. Narcissistic personality disorder was more prevalent in men than women (44% vs. 20%, <i>p</i> = 0.012). Cluster C dependent (52 ± 24 vs. 46 ± 20, <i>p</i> = 0.025) and obsessive-compulsive (54 ± 20 vs. 43 ± 19, <i>p</i> = 0.012) traits scores were elevated in women, but only dependent personality disorder prevalence differed categorically (38% women vs. 15% men, <i>p</i> = 0.012). <b>Conclusions:</b> Employing both dimensional and cluster approaches enriches personality disorder research in AUD. Dependent personality disorder in Cluster C robustly differentiates sexes, while personality disorder patterns in Clusters A and B show minimal sex differences when both approaches are considered.",
