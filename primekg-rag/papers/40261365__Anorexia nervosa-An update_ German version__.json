  "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder with the highest mortality rate among eating disorders. It predominantly affects adolescents and young adults, with a significant increase in prevalence among adolescents observed since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is frequently associated with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders as well as numerous physical complications. An early diagnosis and treatment are associated with better outcomes. The treatment of choice for AN includes cognitive behavioral therapy and family-based therapy for children and adolescents. Innovative treatment approaches, such as home treatment and technology-based interventions, have shown promising preliminary results. With the exception of moderate evidence supporting the use of olanzapine regarding weight gain, there is currently no evidence for the efficacy of psychopharmacotherapy in AN. Future research should focus on prevention, early detection and intervention, relapse prevention, personalized treatment approaches, management of comorbid disorders, long-term studies and the influence of psychosocial factors.",
