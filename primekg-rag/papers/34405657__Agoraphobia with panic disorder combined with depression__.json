The sample consisted of 49 women. The average age was 41.5Â±9.9 years. All patients (<i>n</i>=49; 100%) had symptoms of agoraphobia with panic disorder (F40.01) (<i>n</i>=49; 100%) and recurrent depressive disorder with mild (F33.01) (<i>n</i>=33; 67.3%) or moderate (F33.11) (<i>n</i>=16; 32.7%) severity. The duration of the disease by the time of inclusion in the study was from 2 to 5 years. Clinical-psychopathological, clinical-follow-up, clinical-dynamic, and statistical methods were used. Two types of agoraphobia prevalence with panic disorder were identified. Type I is a relatively favorable one with complete remissions of phobic anxiety and affective disorders (<i>n</i>=29; 59.2%). Type II is an unfavorable one with constant phobic anxiety symptoms (<i>n</i>=20; 40.8%). The predictive factors of the unfavorable type of agoraphobia with panic disorder (APD) combined with depression were psychogenic situations, astheno-vegetative disorders at the onset of APD, gastrointestinal symptoms, senestopathy, fear of going crazy, or loss of control in the structure of a panic attack (PA), morning PA, vertebral artery syndrome, diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, panic attacks with provocation, depression with hysteroform symptoms in pre-manifest period APD, the age at the time of the debut APD, professional status, occupational psychogenic, family microclimate, health problems, endocrine system diseases, severe agoraphobia.",
