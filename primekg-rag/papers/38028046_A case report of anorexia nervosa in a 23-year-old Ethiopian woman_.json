  "title": "A case report of anorexia nervosa in a 23-year-old Ethiopian woman.",
  "abstract": "Limited studies on AN in Africa, including Ethiopia. Internet and media have changed body image portrayal in developing countries. A need for a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, training on positive coaching styles, and future research. The Global Burden of Disease had estimated anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia nervosa to be 13.6 million people. The lifetime prevalence of AN ranges from 2.4 to 4.3 percent. During their lifetime, up to 4% of females and up to 0.3% of males suffer from anorexia nervosa. Studies assessing AN in Africa, including Ethiopia, are limited. This case report describes a 23-year-old female patient who presented with anorectic symptoms and signs in Ethiopia. This case report describes a 23-year-old female patient who participated in sports activities. She had a low body weight based on a BMI of 13.15 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and lost around 10 kg within the past 6 months. She feared gaining weight or becoming fat, thus restricting food intake. The findings on psychiatric evaluation encompassing detailed history and mental state examination suggested the diagnosis of Extreme anorexia nervosa, restricting type; adult malnutrition; major depressive disorder (MDD) (in remission); low risk of aggression; low risk of suicide; severe functional impairment. The general management principles implemented in this patient included assessment of medical complications, weight restoration, psychological intervention, medication for comorbid depression, and long-term psychological and biological treatment follow-up to avoid relapse. The presented case of a 23-year-old Ethiopian female patient who is athletic shows weight-controlled sports activities and the manifestation of anorexia nervosa. Easy access to the Internet and media has changed body image portrayal in developing countries including Ethiopia. There is a need for a multidisciplinary approach involving psychiatrists, psychologists, internists, and nutritionists for the management of AN. The early screening and management of medical complications are crucial. There is a need for close monitoring of vital signs, restriction of caffeine, excess fluid, and salt, and limiting excessive exercise. Furthermore, to assess micronutrient deficiencies, vitamin supplements should be prescribed in the form of multivitamin and thiamine preparations. The need for future training about positive coaching styles for coaches is mandatory to reduce the future impacts on young athletes. There is a need for future research on eating disorders in developing countries such as Ethiopia.",
